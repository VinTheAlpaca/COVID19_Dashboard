# COVID19_Dashboard

### Project objectives

We bulit a prototype of dashboard for demonstrating the spread of covid-19 virus more intuitively with R Shiny.

### Project description

The project is based on R shiny.

It uses data from Johns Hopkins University on infections, deaths and cures of covid-19 in various regions published on GitHub. The whole project mainly uses data visualization and interactive technology. Through cleaning, integration, data transformation and other procedures, the daily data is displayed on the dashboard in the form of map, line chart, table, etc.

### Project achievements

We use shiny to build a dashboard to show the epidemic situation, and use leaflet to build an interactive map on the dashboard to show the general infection situation of each country and region, and use rbokeh to build an interactive line chart to show the trend of the epidemic situation, as well as the dynamic change chart of the 15 countries with the largest number of infections and the table showing the details of the disease in each region.
